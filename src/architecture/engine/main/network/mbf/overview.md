# `_MakeBlendField` Overview

::: warning

Many parts of `zombs_wasm.wasm` are heavily obfuscated, so this part of the documentation only provides an outline of the algorithm. You'll have to figure out the actual code and its behavior during operation by yourself.

:::

::: info

The version of `zombs_wasm.wasm` this overview analyzes is from late 2024, which may not be 100% consistent with the current version.

:::

Zombs.io employs an original method to validate players via [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) (PoW) challenges that the client has to solve in order to enter a server and maintain a connection. It is a measure to occupy RAM and CPU resources of the client and, therefore, increase multiboxing costs.

The main algorithm of the PoW process is written in C++ and compiled into `zombs_wasm.wasm` with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/). Reversing is very difficult due to the low-level nature of the [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) (WASM) language it uses.  

The core function `zombs_wasm.wasm` exposes is called `_MakeBlendField`. From now on, for convenience, `_MakeBlendField` will be referred to as MBF, and `PACKET_PRE_ENTER_WORLD`, `PACKET_ENTER_WORLD`, `PACKET_ENTER_WORLD2` and `PACKET_BLEND` will be accordingly referred to as opcode `5`, `4`, `6` and `10`.

## History

### April 24, 2021 - Minor Update
```md{2}
- Fix towers slowing down after some time due to floating point loss of precision
- Add a challenge / response system to help cut down on bot connections
- Harden game servers a bit against DoS attacks
```
MBF first appeared with this update, along with a WASM module to solve the new validation challenge. At this time, the validation process only employs a single challenge via opcode `5`.

> The way entering servers works has changed. Before:
> 1. You send a "PACKET_ENTER_WORLD" message (opcode 4) containing your name
> 2. The server receives, checks data, then sends you a "PACKET_ENTER_WORLD" message (opcode 4), allowing you in

Explains a community member, [Apex](https://www.youtube.com/@Apex-ti1dm), about how entering the game works before MBF.

### March 6th, 2022 - Minor Update
```md{4}
(no changelog)
```
MBF was upgraded around this time, introducing opcode `6` to the validation process, thus requiring the client to send opcode `6` upon entering the game.

::: info

There was a 25-use limit for the WASM module and a memory leak issue with it around this period, but it is unknown when the limit was removed or when the memory leak issue was fixed.

:::

### December 31, 2023 - Minor Update
```md{1}
- Security update
```

This update introduces opcode `10`.

## Summary

![mbf](/asset/architecture/engine/main/network/mbf/overview/mbf.jpg)

When the client receives an opcode `5` / `10` packet, it has to decode it with `BinCodec` and send back the required data. For opcode `5`, the data will be sent along opcode `4` and `6` packets, while for opcode `10`, a separate opcode `10` packet will be sent. If the client fails to submit data that passes validation within the given time, the client will not be able to enter the server and therefore will be forcefully disconnected from the server.

## Challenge

An opcode `5` / `10` packet contains a 132-byte message, which can be represented by a `Uint8Array`, such as this one shown below:

```js
[139,165,21,124,237,21,234,88,128,192,29,175,28,15,118,27,23,73,18,225,109,252,205,195,45,213,46,51,246,67,218,224,19,28,197,74,97,235,236,131,205,163,61,41,148,171,164,228,104,163,187,238,91,157,27,116,176,245,245,185,89,203,170,255,85,195,243,88,38,230,46,252,7,25,12,191,170,12,159,145,147,193,3,135,145,178,215,57,46,252,35,65,226,130,39,146,41,4,18,27,4,34,201,232,195,133,20,68,19,42,42,74,168,255,4,181,85,189,86,121,144,210,90,82,224,238,5,8,107,176,123,245]
```

This message can further be split into 3 parts: a 32-bit integer (4 bytes) and two 64-byte segments. 

The first byte of the first 64-byte segment is used to determine the logic branch used for the challenge (`byte % <number of branches>`, 0-indexed), where each branch adopts a unique set of constants in various parts of the algorithm. After deobfuscating the integer with a specific formula, two important parameters of the challenge can be inferred: the first 2 bytes (in big-endian order) is the size of the [PRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator)-generated pool (in megabytes), which will later be filled using [Xorshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift)-generated numbers and be used to retrieve a random byte value in later steps of the algorithm while actually occupying memory with its sheer size; the last byte of the integer is the difficulty of the challenge, which determines the rarity of the solution and the time it takes to find such solution. For comparison, the pool size is usually 128 megabytes, while the difficulty is generally 17 for opcode `5` and 9-13 for opcode `10`. The third byte of the deobfuscated integer acts as a flag byte whose lowest bit is usually 0, but if it is 1, a heavy penalty of 100 will be added to the difficulty, causing the challenge to become virtually unsolvable.

::: info

As of early 2025, after a few hours into the connection, opcode `10` packets may reach difficulty 19 or higher, while the pool size is increased to 512 megabytes (the theoretical limit is near 2048 megabytes), significantly increasing the cost of maintaining longer connections.

:::

`blend` and `field`, which are both important components in the MBF process, can be obtained from the two 64-byte segments. They will be further elaborated in the upcoming sections.

## Hash Functions

The hash functions of MBF's algorithm are derived from the [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) hash algorithm, which produces a 20-byte (5 32-bit integers) hash value (digest) from any given input. The hash value changes drastically even with only a slight difference in the input, making creating a solution with the given result without guessing nearly impossible.  
These hash functions resemble that of the original SHA-1 function, but with different sets of constants and partially modified logic for each branch.

## `blend`, `field`, `blend_field` and `mask`

`blend` and `field` (unofficially named after `_MakeBlendField`) are two important components in the MBF process. `blend` is a hash value obtained via reversing the first 64-byte segment and hashing the reversed segment, while `field` is the second 64-byte segment itself. They together produce `blend_field` and `mask`, two crucial elements that participate in the actual PoW loop.
`blend_field` is a 64-byte array produced from applying arithmetic to each byte of `field` with certain bytes in `blend` and a set of magic numbers (153, 111, 72 and 221), and eventually reversing the processed array. It is one of the segments that make up `payload` in the PoW loop, which will be explained later. The first 16 bytes of this array are sent by the client in the opcode `6` packet within a 100-byte [ByteBuffer](https://github.com/protobufjs/bytebuffer.js/) default buffer, like this one:
```js
[161,229,245,1,88,44,180,171,255,85,253,126,113,49,212,239,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
```
`mask` is another hash value that is acquired from appending a 32-bit integer obtained from applying a specific conversion formula to `chall_count` (a 32-bit integer representing the number of PoW challenges the websocket has solved, including the current one) at the end of the array, and then hashing the resulting 24-byte array. It is used to "mask" `random_buffer` to create the PoW result sent by the client in the opcode `5`/`10` packet, which will also be explained later.

## PoW Loop

In order to solve the PoW challenge, the client has to repeatedly change and hash the `payload` until one whose hash value matches the given criteria is found. The payload is an array that can be split into 3 parts: the server's IPv4 address as a string (without the null terminator `\0`), `blend_field`, and a 64-byte `random_buffer`.  
The PRNG used in the loop is the standard C++ [MT19937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) generator paired with [`std::uniform_int_distribution`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/random/uniform_int_distribution/). The seed of the PRNG is obtained from calling `performance.now()` in JavaScript through Emscripten features.

The steps are described below (every array is a 0-indexed byte array):

1. Randomly choose 2 bytes in the random pool and swap them.
2. Pick another byte in the pool randomly and insert it into a random position of `random_buffer`.
3. Set `random_buffer[10/11/12/13]` to `random_buffer[0/40/51/4] + random_buffer[23/25/50/45] + uid[0/1/2/3]` (`uid` is the player's uid expressed in a 32-bit integer) and `random_buffer[14/15/16/17]` to `random_buffer[41/22/35/39] ^ blend_field[0/1/2/3]` (Here, `blend_field[0/1/2/3]` is from the `blend_field` of the first challenge the decoder has solved, usually from an opcode `5` packet).
4. Hash the payload to generate a digest and validate it to check if it matches the criteria. The check is implemented as a leading-zero-bit test: the first `<difficulty>` bits of the digest must all be zero.
5. If the digest meets the criteria, "mask" `random_buffer` by setting `random_buffer[i]` to `random_buffer[i] ^ mask[i % 20]` for every integer `i` in `[0, 64)`; otherwise repeat step 1. The masked array is the result sent by the client in the opcode 5/10 packet, such as this one shown below:

```js
[212,153,0,149,244,56,73,26,178,35,28,213,168,24,168,171,98,149,44,184,17,8,186,240,133,97,240,60,19,240,248,28,116,101,177,105,164,25,88,23,107,205,198,51,106,126,26,249,169,143,150,119,251,252,183,90,184,78,110,34,190,129,82,87]
```

The server's IPv4 address and `uid` is obtained from evaluating JavaScript-side runtime values through Emscripten features. The decoder also performs environment checks through this kind of runtime evaluation as a part of the anti-bot mechanism - if the responses fail to match the expected browser context and game state, difficulty might be increased. There is even a final page-state guard before the MBF response is sent: the module checks whether the in-game HUD element has been populated. On the normal zombs.io web client, this merely serves as a sanity check, but in an alternate or non-web environment, the produced response can be invalidated by extra shuffling before it is copied out. This makes MBF depend not only on the mathematical PoW loop, but also on enough surrounding client state to resemble the real game runtime.

## Bugs

When the zombs.io website client tries to connect to a server whose IPv4 address is shorter than one that the client tried before, it throws the error shown below because the `_free()` function isn't exported in `zombs_wasm.wasm`. Fix this by adding `func $6` in `zombs_wasm.wasm` (which is the `free()` function in C++) to the exports. For custom clients instantiating `zombs_wasm.wasm` each time they connect, this can be ignored.

![error_1](/asset/architecture/engine/main/network/mbf/overview/error_1.png)

## Trivia

- The abbreviation "MBF" can be inferred from the first 3 bytes of the instantiated WASM memory.
- When the client tries to decode an opcode `5` / `10` packet using an outdated `zombs_wasm.wasm` file, the client may freeze or throw an error because using the wrong deobfuscation formula might yield an unreasonably high difficulty or random pool size, and thus trigger an indefinite loop or a memory overflow.  
- The term "0MB Wasm", often used by the zombs.io community, refers to custom MBF algorithms that significantly reduce RAM usage by limiting the size of the random pool. This can be achieved through either analyzing the logic and rebuilding the whole algorithm or directly manipulating `zombs_wasm.wasm` by editing its text format (`.wat`). However, the mathematical nature of PoW challenges causes a significant reduction in CPU usage and computing time to be highly unlikely. (Otherwise ez cryptocurrency mining :P)

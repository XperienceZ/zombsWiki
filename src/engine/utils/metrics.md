# Metrics

The `Metrics` class is responsible for collecting and reporting performance data to the server. It tracks various indicators such as FPS, ping, and client-side lag.

## `Metrics` <Badge type="tip" text="public" />

Bounded to `game` as `game.metrics`. Alias: `MetricsType`

### Methods

#### `constructor()`

```ts
function constructor(): void;
```

Initializes the metrics state and sets up event handlers for network status (`close`, `error`), server response (`PACKET_ENTER_WORLD`) and renderer ticks.

#### `getFramesExtrapolated()`

```ts
function getFramesExtrapolated(): number;
```

Returns the number of frames that have been extrapolated.

#### `reset()`

```ts
function reset(): void;
```

Resets all metrics counters and samples to their initial state.

#### `updateMetrics()`

```ts
function updateMetrics(): boolean;
```

Updates the internal `metrics` object with the latest data from the `world` and `network`. Returns `true` if the update was successful.

#### `sendMetrics()`

```ts
function sendMetrics(): void;
```

Sends the current metrics to the server via an RPC call if at least 5 seconds have passed since the last report.
